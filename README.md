# Kita Menu Plan
An alexa skill and webapp to make the weekly menu of our kita accessible by Echo devices.

## Motivation
From time to time it is quite useful to know what children are getting for lunch, e.g. it might result in undesired results when it comes to tomato sauce in conjunction with a white t-shirt.
In addition I would like to harden experience in building distributed systems, especially when using the cloud or one of the big cloud providers.
